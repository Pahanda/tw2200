# Sample TW2200 Configuration File

# Please read carefully, as setting incorrect options or changing them for an existing server can have
# unpleasant consequences!

[Configuration]

#### Core Server Settings

# The ServerName parameter is a short string that will identify your server.
#   Default:
# ServerName = Sample TW2200 Server
ServerName = Sample TW2200 Server

# The ServerPort parameter is an integer TCP port number that the server will bind to.  Make sure that you adjust
# your firewall settings accordingly if you'd like clients to be able to connect!
#   Default:
# ServerPort = 22001
ServerPort = 22001

# The ServerIP parameter is the IP address of the interface that your server will bind to.  You should only need to
# change this if your server has more than one IP address.
#   Default:
# ServerIP = 127.0.0.1
ServerIP = 127.0.0.1


#### Server Performance

# The ServerMaxListeners parameter is the maximum number of connections that the server will listen for.  This is
# *not* the same as the maximum number of simulataneous players; this is the number of *new* connections that the
# server will queue up at once to get a thread for client communication.  As these are typically quickly established,
# the default value here will ususally be sufficient.  If you get complaints from clients about connections refused,
# you might need to increase this value.
#   Default:
# ServerMaxListeners = 5
ServerMaxListeners = 5

ServerReserveAdminSlots = 1
